            <p>Misc Coffee is a neighborhood café located in the heart of Peninsula Center, created with the idea of offering a place that feels warm, simple, and genuine. We believe a café should be more than a stop on your morning routine — it should feel like a small, welcoming part of your day. Misc Coffee was built around that vision: thoughtfully crafted drinks, fresh pastries, and a calm atmosphere where anyone can settle in and feel at ease.</p>
            <p>Our name, “Misc,” reflects the mix of people, stories, and everyday moments that fill our space. We take pride in serving high-quality coffee made with carefully selected beans, skilled preparation, and attention to detail. Every drink is made with consistency and care, and our pastries and baked goods are chosen to pair perfectly with a quiet morning, a study session, or an afternoon catch-up.</p>
            <p>What truly defines us is our connection to the Peninsula Center community. We chose this neighborhood because it’s a place where people value comfort, creativity, and local connection. From familiar regulars to new visitors, every person who walks through our doors shapes the spirit of our café. We believe in hospitality that feels friendly and natural — never rushed, never pretentious.</p>
            <p>At Misc Coffee, we focus on creating an environment that encourages slowing down. Soft lighting, clean design, and a relaxed vibe make our café a space where you can work, unwind, or simply enjoy a moment of quiet. Whether you’re grabbing your usual order or exploring something new, we hope each visit leaves you feeling a little more grounded.</p>
            <p>Misc Coffee is built on small details, good coffee and genuine community, a place where everyday moments matter and everyone can feel at home!</p>
